Project2-Getting-Cleaning-Data
==============================

The purpose of this repo is to store project files created for the project assignment of the Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera.

The following files were produced:
- run_analysis.R: contains the code to produce the requested tidy data;
- CodeBook.md: contains the explanation of the steps executed to produce run_analysis.R and the variables;
- README.md: this file, a brief explanation of this repository.

In order to produce the file *final_data.txt* you need to download the zip file and unzip it to the working directory. run_analysis.R must be run from there (the working directory and not inside the directory created for the data set to be processed).
